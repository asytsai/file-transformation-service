# File Transformation Service

## Overview

This is a service that takes a binary file, sends it to the external service that does file transformation, and returns 
the transformed file.


## Running the service

#### `Makefile` command breakdown

To **build** and **test** the project locally, use:

```make
make build-and-test
```

Or to just **run** the project **without compiling anew**, use:

```make
make run-local
```
